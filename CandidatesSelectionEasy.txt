PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel wants to hire a new maid.
There are n candidates for the position.
There are m different skills a maid should have, such as cooking, cleaning, or discreetness.
Ciel numbered the candidates 0 through n-1 and the skills 0 through m-1.



Ciel evaluated the level each candidate has in each of the skills.
You are given this information encoded in a vector <string> score with n elements, each consisting of m characters.
For each i and j, the character score[i][j] represents the level candidate i has in skill j.
Said character will always be between 'A' and 'Z', inclusive, where 'A' means the best possible and 'Z' the worst possible candidate.



You are also given an int x.
Ciel thinks that skill x is the most important skill a maid should have.



Return a vector <int> with n elements: the numbers of all candidates, ordered according to their level in skill x from the best to the worst.
Candidates who have the same level in skill x should be ordered by their number in ascending order.

DEFINITION
Class:CandidatesSelectionEasy
Method:sort
Parameters:vector <string>, int
Returns:vector <int>
Method signature:vector <int> sort(vector <string> score, int x)

EXAMPLES

0)
{"ACB", "BAC", "CBA"}
1

Returns: {1, 2, 0 }

The output should be {1, 2, 0}, because the level of candidate 1 in skill 1 is 'A', the level of candidate 2 in this skill is 'B', and the level of candidate 0 is 'C'.

1)
{"A", "C", "B", "C", "A"}
0

Returns: {0, 4, 2, 1, 3 }

Note that when 2 candidates have same level, they will remain in the original order.

2)
{"LAX","BUR","ONT","LGB","SAN","SNA","SFO","OAK","SJC"}
2

Returns: {5, 3, 8, 7, 4, 6, 1, 2, 0 }



3)
{"BBCBABAC","BCBACABA","CCCBAACB","CACABABB","AABBBBCC"}
6

Returns: {0, 1, 3, 2, 4 }



4)
{"XXYWZWWYXZ","YZZZYWYZYW","ZYZZWZYYWW","ZWZWZWZXYW","ZYXWZXWYXY","YXXXZWXWXW","XWWYZWXYXY","XYYXYWYXWY","ZZYXZYZXYY","WXZXWYZWYY"}
3

Returns: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 6, 1, 2 }



5)
