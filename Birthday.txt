PROBLEM STATEMENT
Forgetting a close friend's birthday is quite embarrassing, but forgetting it two years in a row is a catastrophe.
So what can a coder do to prevent this from happening again? Well, the thing he possibly can do best: code...

Given a string date (the current date) and a vector <string> birthdays, a list of
people's birthdays and names, return a string, the date of the next occurring birthday, starting from the current date.

date is in the format "MM/DD" (quotes for clarity), where MM represents the two-digit month and DD represents the two-digit day (leading zero if necessary).
Each element of birthdays is in the format "MM/DD <Name>" (quotes for clarity), where MM/DD is the date of <Name>'s birthday. <Name> is a sequence of characters from 'A'-'Z' and 'a'-'z'. There is exactly one space character between the date and <Name>. The date returned also has to be in the format "MM/DD" (quotes for clarity).
